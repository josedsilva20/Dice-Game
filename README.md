# Dice-Game
A website to randomize two dices.

It is a project form AppBrewery and itÂ´s a challenge for every student willing to learn about web development (in this case using html, css and mainly javascript).

Hope you guys enjoy it and give feedback if you think something should get better. ThereÂ´s a lot of effort in all of this iÂ´ve done so far!

This website can be accessed through https://josedsilva20.github.io/Dice-Game/.

Thank you!! ðŸ˜Š
